          <p>This is a little project I made under influence of another David Shiffman’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ6pMLp_IaI">video</a>. The implementation I found rather intriguing and interesting to redo in SVG. Here is my attempt - I’ve used a code in <a href="https://github.com/CodingTrain">Coding Train</a> repo for <a href="https://github.com/CodingTrain/StarPatterns">Islamic Star Patterns</a> and completely rewrite it for vanilla Javascript and rendering in SVG. This project really helped me to understand OOP paradigm in JS, and helped a lot in the next project (You’ll see it very soon), and to understand how SVG animation working.</p>

          <p>Hey everyone! After yesterday attempt to code random walker, I thought it would be a good idea to implement almost same thing but with vector object. As far as I know it’s common practice to use vectors to describe coordinates and speed of objects - and it turns to be a good idea in this little do-it-after-came-back-from-work project. Previous version of random walker is <a href="https://IgorKonovalov.github.io/projects/2017/01/31/Simple_Random_walker.html">here</a></p>

          <p>While working on <a href="https://igorkonovalov.github.io/projects/2017/01/04/Game_of_life.html">Game Of Life</a> - I’ve became interested in Cellular Automation, and found another interesting example to do - Elementary cellular automaton. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton">Wikipedia</a>, “… an elementary cellular automaton is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where there are two possible states (labeled 0 and 1) and the rule to determine the state of a cell in the next generation depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors.” It was  Super simple, right? But it was well challenging for me as for a novice programmer, and also lead to some new knowledge and understanding of what’s going on. It’s 255 different rules instead of three in Game Of Life, but they do not implement simultaniously, one rule per one automata. There is a big list of all the rules can be found <a href="http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/">here</a>. The most interesting ones I used in my project. Also, this automata is kind of boring and I added some colour fun. So, take a look!</p>

          <p>For a little while I’ve been working on a project - an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> in Javascript. It was one of the exercises in excellent book <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a> and first one that actually made me really interested in programming process itself.
For couple of days I wasn’t eating and sleeping and just programming this thing and thinking about it. And when it was actually done - that was really amazing. I haven’t felt myself like this since childhood. Good start of the year! So, the source for the game <a href="https://github.com/IgorKonovalov/Little_projects/tree/master/Game_of_Life">can be found on my Github</a>, and you can play it right below! The usage is very basic, but I’m sure that I will continue to contribute to the project to make it more user-friendly and nice.</p>

          <p>Hi everybody!
Partially as a little challenge to myself, partially for expiriense in English writing (I’m a native Russian) I started a blog today.
I will be using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for static blog, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a> for hosting. The markdown syntax is totally new to me, so as english writing so many mistakes is on its way!</p>
