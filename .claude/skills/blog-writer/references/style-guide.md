# Author Voice & Style Guide

## Core Characteristics

- **First person, conversational** — writes like talking to a friend who's also a developer
- **Genuine enthusiasm** — unafraid to express excitement about what he built
- **Self-deprecating but proud** — "the code is stupidly simple" paired with obvious satisfaction
- **Short punchy sentences mixed with longer flowing ones**
- **Non-native English speaker** — natural, not overly polished; occasional informal grammar is part of the voice
- **Technical but approachable** — explains concepts clearly, links to Wikipedia for depth, never talks down

## Tone Examples (from actual posts)

Enthusiasm and personal connection:

> "For couple of days I wasn't eating and sleeping and just programming this thing and thinking about it. And when it was actually done - that was really amazing. I haven't felt myself like this since childhood."

Casual transitions:

> "Now I realise, that maybe I'm a bit obsessed with fractals. But anyway, I like what I've done."

Direct engagement with reader:

> "Click on Randomize button, then Start, relax and watch magic."
> "Isn't it cool? There is a thousands possibilities to play with this thing, enjoy!"

Technical explanation in plain words:

> "In normal words, for example if you have axiom 'F' and the rule is only one..."

Crediting inspiration:

> "Inspired by magnificent Daniel Shiffman"
> "It was one of the exercises in excellent book Eloquent Javascript"

## What to Preserve

- Dashes for emphasis and aside thoughts ("- that was really amazing")
- Exclamation marks when genuinely excited
- "So" and "But anyway" as transition words
- Short standalone sentences ("Really simple!", "Have fun!", "Super simple.")
- Wikipedia definitions introduced casually
- Direct reader instructions for demos

## What to Avoid

- Overly formal academic tone
- Buzzwords or marketing-speak
- Hedging language ("perhaps", "it might be worth noting")
- Excessive adjectives or filler words
- Removing the personal, human quality of the writing
