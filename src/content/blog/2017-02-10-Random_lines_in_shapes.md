I came to this small project after watching [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ6pMLp_IaI) by Daniel Shiffman

I haven't made a full version of star patterns yet, before finishing I found this interesting pattern:
draw a shape (hexagon, scuare or triangle), then find a random point in each edge of figure, and draw a random lines between this random points. Sometimes you can get an interesting results with this simple rules. Try it and save the result with download button!

<!-- Demo: Random Lines in SVG Shapes (will be added in Phase 5) -->
