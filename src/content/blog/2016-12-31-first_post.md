description: 'First blog post - Hello World!'

Hi everybody!
Partially as a little challenge to myself, partially for expiriense in English writing (I'm a native Russian) I started a blog today.
I will be using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for static blog, and [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. The markdown syntax is totally new to me, so as english writing so many mistakes is on its way!
Soon I'll add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments, and first little project is coming.

Happy New Year!!!

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```
