import MaurerRoseWalker from '../../components/demos/MaurerRoseWalker.astro';

This is a simple walker, reflecting given path. The path is mathematical rose - you can read about it in [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)>) and have a look into another small project I did with this shapes [here](/projects/2017/02/14/maurer_rose/)

Project inspired by [@beesandbombs](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs) and [@shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman) - take a look at them - they are both amazing!
