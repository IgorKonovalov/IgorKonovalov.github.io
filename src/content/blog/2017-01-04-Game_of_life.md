For a little while I've been working on a first real (at least for me) project - an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Javascript. It was one of the exercises in excellent book [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and first one that actually made me really interested in programming process itself.
For couple of days I wasn't eating and sleeping and just programming this thing and thinking about it. And when it was actually done - that was really amazing. I haven't felt myself like this since childhood. Good start of the year! So, the source for the game [can be found on my Github](https://github.com/IgorKonovalov/Little_projects/tree/master/Game_of_Life), and you can play it right below! The usage is very basic, but I'm sure that I will continue to contribute to the project to make it more user-friendly and nice.

Click on Randomize button, then Start, relax and watch magic.

There is a lot written about this particular game - start from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and move on.
I suggest you try a few patterns (refresh page, click on canvas to change color, then start):
